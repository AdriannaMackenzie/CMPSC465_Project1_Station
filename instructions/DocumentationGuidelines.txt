Documentation:
Each source file (.cpp or .h file) should contain the following three types of documentation:

I. File Name:
Each file of your projects should be named beginning "proj" followed by the assignment number. For example, the fifth project should be named: proj5.cpp, or proj5.h.

II. Prologue:
The following format should be used at the beginning of each file:

/**

*File Name: Begin with "assign" and then the assignment number, for example, proj1.cpp, or proj1.h. You must have the extension .cpp or .h

*Academic Integrity Statement: I certify that, while others may have assisted me in brain storming, debugging and validating this program, the program itself is my own work. I understand that submitting code which is the work of other individuals is a violation of the course Academic Integrity Policy and may result in a zero credit for the assignment, or course failure and a report to the Academic Dishonesty Board. I also understand that if I knowingly give my original work to another individual that it could also result in a zero credit for the assignment, or course failure and a report to the Academic Dishonesty Board.

*Assisted by and Assisted line numbers:


*Your Name: XXXXXXXXXXX

*Your PSU user ID:  abc123

*Course title (e.g. CMPSC122 Semester 20XX) 

*Due Time: Time, Day-of-week, Month Day, Year

*Time of Last Modification: Time, Day-of-week, Month Day, Year

*Description: What does it do?

III. Comments and Structuring:
Comments the purpose at every point of the program at which the reader needs help in understanding. Make the program largely self-explanatory by arranging it in an intelligent way and giving informative names to your variables and procedures. Then fewer comments are needed since you must only comment the non-obvious. Maintain consistent indentation.

IV. Output:
You are required to copy and paste your program's standard output as the comment in your source code file right after the main function for all program assignments
